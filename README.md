The California State Template is a .NET MVC template and website standard offered by the California Department of Technology to state agencies and departments within the State of California and beyond. Please visit webtools.ca.gov for more information.

This is a Beta release which means it is a pre-release of software that is given out to a large group of users to try under real conditions. Beta versions have gone through alpha testing inhouse and are generally fairly close in look, feel and function to the final product; however, design changes often occur as a result. 

We encourage you to utilize GitHub to provide feedback and collaborate on the development of the next California state template! For questions please email Info.Eservices@state.ca.gov
